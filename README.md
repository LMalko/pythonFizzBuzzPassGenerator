# Programming basics with Python - Trial BFA #1

Checkpoint assingment:

Create 2 modules:
1. fizzbuzz_module
2. passwordgen_module

1. fizzbuzz_module should contain function that should work as follows:

Write a function called "fizzbuzz", which modifies the list of numbers as the following:
- for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number,
- and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”,
- for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

It should have also a function that will print the numbers from 1 to 100 using fizbuzz function.


2. passwordgen_module should contain a function that should work as follows:

Write a password generator in Python.
Be creative with how you generate passwords:
strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
The passwords should be minimum 8 characters long, random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
Include your generator code in the "passwordgen" function.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

If you feel you need more functions, you can add them wherever they fit.

To check correctness of your code run test.py. Your code have to pass all tests to get 10 points for "Conforming to the requirements".
